The Del Norte Ticuu Group is an independent organization dedicated to researching and developing secure systems.

We are focused primarily on applied cryptography in a post-quantum encryption world in addition to general systems security. Our work spans protocol design, software development, and cryptanalysis. We are students who believe that the integrity of communication and the right to privacy are non-negotiable principles in the digital age.

This organization exists not out of paranoia, but out of pattern recognition. Surveillance is no longer speculative (in fact, it hasn't been for a number of decades) &mdash; it is systemic, industrial, and pervasive.  We do not trust our government. We have read the history. We have *seen* the history. We understand how power consolidates and how it smothers freedom.

We refuse to be silent.

Our principle is simple: no government, no corporation, no unelected bureaucracy should have unrestricted access to private lives. The infrastructure of the internet must be built for the people who use it, not the ones who monitor it. We build secure systems not because we are hiding, but because we refuse to be catalogued by frankly unaccountable powers.

*Three points, pushed through forever.*
